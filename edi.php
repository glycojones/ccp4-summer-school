    <h2>Statement on equity and inclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The organisers are committed to making the school
      productive and enjoyable for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity,

      We will not tolerate harassment of participants, students or tutors, in any form.

      We are committed to achieving a balanced and diverse panel of speakers
      at all our events by inviting speakers of all
      races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and sexual orientation
      without compromising the quality,
      and remaining within the topic, of the programme.
      All speakers will have agreed to the Code of Conduct prior to agreeing
      to speak at the event.
