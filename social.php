        <p>A cèilidh is a traditional Scottish and Irish social event involving dancing and live folk music. The English variant of a cèilidh introduced a "caller", a musician who shows dancers the next dance move. 
           Callers usually have a very good understanding of the rhythms involved in songs and different types UK regional dances, allowing them to pick the right tune and dance for every audience.
