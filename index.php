    <h2>The CCP4-BCA Summer School returns to the North!</h2>
    <p>
      It is a great pleasure to announce the return of the CCP4-BCA Summer School on
      macromolecular crystallography and associated techniques. Running for the first
      time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the school aims to bring together early-career
      scientists from the UK, Europe and beyond and train them in the latest advances
      in structural biology, with a primary focus on macromolecular crystallography. 
      The school, which was formerly run at the University of St. Andrews for many years, 
      has trained hundreds of crystallographers while also providing them with unforgettable 
      collective memories. The York team aims to capture and continue the essence and tradition
      of the school, blending it with the best the City of York has to offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      All aspects of structure solution will be covered during the
      workshop, from data collection through to phasing, refinement,
      validation and deposition.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lectures and tutorials will be delivered by experts in the field,
        sometimes even software authors themselves!
      </li>
      <li>
        An exciting social programme will showcase
        some of the best the historical City of York can offer - and in summer.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will be able to work alongside world-leading scientists
        and methods developers on your own projects.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The school will be based at <b>The University of York's Campus West</b>,
      with lectures in the main Biology building, workshops
      in a PC room in James College and accommodation in Vanbrugh College.
